## Etymology of Ghoti
George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950), polymath, playwright, Nobel prize winner, and
the most prolific letter writer in history, was an advocate of English spelling reform.
He was reportedly fond of pointing out its absurdities by proving that ‘fish’ could be
spelt ‘ghoti’. That is: ‘gh’ as in ‘rough’, ‘o’ as in ‘women’ and ‘ti’ as in palatial.
